## Task
Please write an Ellipsis directive or component, your choice which to implement, which should
decide on its own when to be applied based on the available space.
- There should be a tooltip with the full text when the ellipsis is applied.
- The directive/component should be performant, i.e if I put 1000 of these on the page it
should still work without freezing or causing performance glitches for the user.


## Result
 There is a two types of table cells
   1. Cell with a short text (first cell in a table)
   2. Cell with a long text, visually overflowed by an ellipsis (1000 cells)
   
   Tooltip is applied to all of them, but pops up **only** for a long text.
   Tooltip pops up on mouse hover over table cell.

### System design contains 3 items:
  - service: BL
  - component: UI
  - directive: "controller", uses service and defines bounds and content of component.
